This fork of the FreeBSD fork of Intel_Backlight (originally of
intel-gpu-tools) reverts a seemingly senseless change which prevented
actually turning _off_ the backlight in the FreeBSD version. This was
easily done in the original Linux version, and I used it frequently.

It also adds finer grained control via support for decimal numbers
in command line input.

##########
This allows to control the backlight level on certain Intel(R) GPUs,
including i915.

This has been taken from intel-gpu-tools which can be found
here: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/

Originally ported to FreeBSD by "emmex" of the FreeBSD forums.

Build:
  pkg install libpciaccess libdrm
  make
  make install-setuid-strip

(this installs intel_backlight setuid root, so any user can execute it).

Usage:
  $ intel_backlight
  current backlight value: 30% (281/937)
  $ intel_backlight 50
  current backlight value: 15% (141/937)
  set backlight to 50% (469/937)
  $ intel_backlight incr
  current backlight value: 50% (469/937)
  set backlight to 51% (478/937)
  $ intel_backlight incr
  current backlight value: 51% (478/937)
  set backlight to 60% (562/937)
  $ intel_backlight incr
  current backlight value: 60% (562/937)
  set backlight to 70% (656/937)
  $ intel_backlight decr
  current backlight value: 70% (656/937)
  set backlight to 60% (562/937)
  $ intel_backlight decr
  current backlight value: 60% (562/937)
  set backlight to 51% (478/937)

The included example allows adjusting brightness automatically based on the
input of the isl driver (currently not part of standard FreeBSD).

Usage:
  ./isl_backlight.sh &
